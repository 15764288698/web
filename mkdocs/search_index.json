The\nprimary purpose is to show how a transient system of nonlinear equations can be\nformulated in MFEM. The equations are solved in conservative form\n\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot {\\bf F}(u) = 0$$\n\n\nwith a state vector $u = [ \\rho, \\rho v_0, \\rho v_1, \\rho E ]$, where $\\rho$ is\nthe density, $v_i$ is the velocity in the $i^{\\rm th}$ direction, $E$ is the\ntotal specific energy, and $H = E + p / \\rho$ is the total specific enthalpy.\nThe pressure, $p$ is computed through a simple equation of state (EOS) call.\nThe conservative hydrodynamic flux ${\\bf F}$ in each direction $i$ is\n\n\n$${\\bf F_{\\it i}} = [ \\rho v_i, \\rho v_0 v_i + p \\delta_{i,0}, \\rho v_1 v_i + p \\delta_{i,1}, \\rho v_i H ]$$\n\n\nSpecifically, the example solves for an exact solution of the equations whereby\na vortex is transported by a uniform flow. Since all boundaries are periodic\nhere, the method's accuracy can be assessed by measuring the difference between\nthe solution and the initial condition at a later time when the vortex returns\nto its initial location.\n\n\nNote that as the order of the spatial discretization increases, the timestep\nmust become smaller. This example currently uses a simple estimate derived by\n\nCockburn and Shu\n\nfor the 1D RKDG method. An additional factor can be tuned by passing the \n--cfl\n\n(or \n-c\n shorter) flag.\n\n\nThe example demonstrates user-defined bilinear and nonlinear form integrators\nfor systems of equations that are defined with block vectors, and how these are\nused with an operator for explicit time integrators. In this case the system\nalso involves an external approximate Riemann solver for the DG interface flux.\nIt also demonstrates how to use GLVis for in-situ visualization of vector grid\nfunctions.\n\n\nThe example has a serial (\nex18.cpp\n)\nand a parallel (\nex18p.cpp\n) version.\nWe recommend viewing examples 9, 14 and 17 before viewing this example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 19: Incompressible Nonlinear Elasticity\n\n\n\n\nThis example code solves the quasi-static incompressible nonlinear\nhyperelasticity equations.

To handle the incompressibility constraint, pressure is included as\nan independent unknown $p$ and the stress response is modeled as an \nincompressible\nneo-Hookean hyperelastic solid\n.\nThe geometry of the domain is assumed to be as follows:\n\n\n\n\nThis formulation requires solving the saddle point system\n$$ \\left[ \\begin{array}{cc}\n   K \nB^T \\\\\n   B \n 0\n\\end{array} \\right]\n\\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\Delta u \\\\ \\Delta p \\end{array} \\right] =\n\\left[\\begin{array}{c} R_u \\\\ R_p \\end{array} \\right]\n$$\nat each Newton step.

It minimizes the quantity\n\n\n$$\\sum_T \\int_T \\mu(J(x)),$$\n\n\nwhere $T$ are the target (ideal) elements, $J$ is the Jacobian of the\ntransformation from the target to the physical element, and $\\mu$ is the mesh\nquality metric.\n\n\nThis metric can measure shape, size or alignment of the region around each\nquadrature point. The combination of targets and quality metrics is used to\noptimize the physical node positions, i.e., they must be as close as possible to\nthe shape / size / alignment of their targets.\n\n\nThis code also demonstrates a possible use of nonlinear operators, as well as\ntheir coupling to Newton methods for solving minimization problems. Note that\nthe utilized Newton methods are oriented towards avoiding invalid meshes with\nnegative Jacobian determinants. Each Newton step requires the inversion of a\nJacobian matrix, which is done through an inner linear solver.\n\n\nFor more details, please see the \ndocumentation\n in the\n\nminiapps/meshing\n directory.\n\n\nThe miniapp has a serial\n(\nmesh-optimizer.cpp\n) and a\nparallel (\npmesh-optimizer.cpp\n)\nversion.\n\nWe recommend that new users start with the example codes before moving to the miniapps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaghos Miniapp\n\n\n\n\nLaghos\n (LAGrangian High-Order Solver) is a miniapp that solves the\ntime-dependent Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics in a moving\nLagrangian frame using unstructured high-order finite element spatial\ndiscretization and explicit high-order time-stepping.\n\n\nThe computational motives captured in Laghos include:\n\n\n\n\nSupport for unstructured meshes, in 2D and 3D, with quadrilateral and\n  hexahedral elements (triangular and tetrahedral elements can also be used, but\n  with the less efficient full assembly option). Serial and parallel mesh\n  refinement options can be set via a command-line flag.\n\n\nExplicit time-stepping loop with a variety of time integrator options. Laghos\n  supports Runge-Kutta ODE solvers of orders 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6.\n\n\nContinuous and discontinuous high-order finite element discretization spaces\n  of runtime-specified order.\n\n\nMoving (high-order) meshes.\n\n\nSeparation between the assembly and the quadrature point-based computations.\n\n\nPoint-wise definition of mesh size, time-step estimate and artificial\n  viscosity coefficient.\n\n\nConstant-in-time velocity mass operator that is inverted iteratively on\n  each time step. This is an example of an operator that is prepared once (fully\n  or partially assembled), but is applied many times. The application cost is\n  dominant for this operator.\n\n\nTime-dependent force matrix that is prepared every time step (fully or\n  partially assembled) and is applied just twice per \"assembly\". Both the\n  preparation and the application costs are important for this operator.\n\n\nDomain-decomposed MPI parallelism.\n\n\nOptional in-situ visualization with \nGLVis\n and data output\n  for visualization / data analysis with \nVisIt\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe Laghos miniapp is part of the \nCEED software suite\n,\na collection of software benchmarks, miniapps, libraries and APIs for\nefficient exascale discretizations based on high-order finite element\nand spectral element methods.

The latter is the recommended visualization software for MFEM (though its use is optional).\n\n\nTo build the serial example codes, type \nmake\n in MFEM's examples directory:\n\n\n~/mfem/examples\n make\ng++ -O3 -I.. ex1.cpp -o ex1 -L.. -lmfem\ng++ -O3 -I.. ex2.cpp -o ex2 -L.. -lmfem\ng++ -O3 -I.. ex3.cpp -o ex3 -L.. -lmfem\ng++ -O3 -I.. ex4.cpp -o ex4 -L.. -lmfem\ng++ -O3 -I.. ex5.cpp -o ex5 -L.. -lmfem\ng++ -O3 -I.. ex6.cpp -o ex6 -L.. -lmfem\ng++ -O3 -I.. ex7.cpp -o ex7 -L.. -lmfem\ng++ -O3 -I.. ex8.cpp -o ex8 -L.. -lmfem\ng++ -O3 -I.. ex9.cpp -o ex9 -L.. -lmfem\ng++ -O3 -I.. ex10.cpp -o ex10 -L.. -lmfem\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nThis example code demonstrates the use of MFEM to define a simple\nlinear finite element discretization of the Laplace problem\n$-\\Delta u = 1$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.

Typically each element is\ncontained in the support of several basis functions of both the domain and range\nspaces, therefore bilinear integrators simultaneously compute the integrals of\nall combinations of the relevant basis functions from the domain and range\nspaces.  This produces a two dimensional array of results that are arranged into\na small dense matrix of integral values called a  local element (stiffness)\nmatrix .  To put this another way, the  BilinearForm  class builds a global, sparse,\nfinite element matrix,  glb_mat , by performing the outer loop in the following\npseudocode snippet whereas the  BilinearFormIntegrator  class performs the\nnested inner loops to compute the dense local element matrix,  loc_mat .  for each elem in elements\n   loc_mat = 0.0\n   for each pt in quadrature_points\n      for each u_j in elem\n         for each v_i in elem\n            loc_mat(i,j) += w(pt) * u_j(pt) v_i(pt)\n         end\n      end\n   end\n   glb_mat += loc_mat\nend  There are three types of integrals that typically arise although many other,\nmore exotic, forms are possible:   Integrals involving Scalar basis functions: $\\int_\\Omega \\lambda\\, u v$  Integrals involving Vector basis functions: $\\int_\\Omega \\lambda\\, \\vec{u}\\cdot\\vec{v}$  Integrals involving Scalar and Vector basis functions: $\\int_\\Omega u\\,\\vec{\\lambda}\\cdot\\vec{v}$   The  BilinearFormIntegrator  classes allow MFEM to produce a wide variety of\nlocal element matrices without modifying the  BilinearForm  class.  Many of the\npossible operators are collected below into tables that briefly describe their\naction and requirements.  In the tables below the  Space  column refers to finite element spaces which\nimplement the following methods:     Space  Operator  Derivative Operator      H1  CalcShape  CalcDShape    ND  CalcVShape  CalcCurlShape    RT  CalcVShape  CalcDivShape    L2  CalcShape  None     The  Coef.  column refers to the types of coefficients that are\navailable.  A boldface coefficient type is required whereas most\ncoefficients are optional.     Coef.  Type      S  Scalar Valued Function    V  Vector Valued Function    D  Diagonal Matrix Function    M  General Matrix Function     Notation: The integrals performed by the various integrators listed\nbelow are shown using inner product notation, $(\\cdot,\\cdot)$, defined\nas follows.  $$(\\lambda u, v)\\equiv \\int_\\Omega \\lambda u v$$\n$$(\\lambda\\vec{u}, \\vec{v})\\equiv \\int_\\Omega\\lambda\\vec{u}\\cdot\\vec{v}$$  Where $u$ or $\\vec{u}$ is a function in the domain (or trial) space and $v$\nor $\\vec{v}$ is in the range (or test) space.\nFor boundary integrators, the integrals are over $\\partial \\Omega$.\nFace integrators integrate over the interior and boundary faces of mesh elements\nand are denoted with $\\left \\cdot,\\cdot\\right $.  Note that any operators involving a derivative of the range function\n$v$ or $\\vec{v}$ are computed using integration by parts.  This leads\nto a boundary integral which can be used to apply Neumann boundary\nconditions.  Some of these operators are listed along with their\nboundary terms in section  Weak Operators .",

However, this must be done with care\nbecause different discrete representations are not completely\ninterchangeable.\n\n\nAs an example consider a scalar field projected onto either piece-wise\nlinear ($H_1$) or piece-wise constant ($L_2$) basis functions.\nInterpolating from an $H_1$ representation to an $L_2$ representation\nshould produce a reasonable result because the constant value needed\nin each element can be computed as a weighted sum of the $H_1$ basis\nfunctions in that element.  On the other hand, if we try to\ninterpolate from the $L_2$ representation to an $H_1$ representation\nwe don't have enough information to determine reasonable values for\nthe degrees of freedom which are shared between neighboring elements\nbecause linear interpolators can only access one element at a time.\nTo accurately compute an $H_1$ representation from an $L_2$\nrepresentation requires the type of weighted average of values from\nneighboring elements that bilinear forms provide but this requires a\nlinear solve and often suitable boundary conditions.\n\n\nThe operators produced by the \nBilinearForm\n classes involve\nintegrations and therefore they sum the various contributions from\nneighboring elements to compute a full integral.  The\n\nDiscreteLinearOperator\n classes are not performing integrals but\nrather interpolations and as such they do not combine contributions\nfrom different elements in any way.  Consequently if the\n\nLinearInterpolator\ns produce different results for entities that are\nshared between neighboring elements then the resulting representation\nwill depend on the order in which the elements are processed.  Such\noperators are not good candidates for \nDiscreteLinearOperator\ns.

However, this must be done with care\nbecause different discrete representations are not completely\ninterchangeable.  As an example consider a scalar field projected onto either piece-wise\nlinear ($H_1$) or piece-wise constant ($L_2$) basis functions.\nInterpolating from an $H_1$ representation to an $L_2$ representation\nshould produce a reasonable result because the constant value needed\nin each element can be computed as a weighted sum of the $H_1$ basis\nfunctions in that element.  On the other hand, if we try to\ninterpolate from the $L_2$ representation to an $H_1$ representation\nwe don't have enough information to determine reasonable values for\nthe degrees of freedom which are shared between neighboring elements\nbecause linear interpolators can only access one element at a time.\nTo accurately compute an $H_1$ representation from an $L_2$\nrepresentation requires the type of weighted average of values from\nneighboring elements that bilinear forms provide but this requires a\nlinear solve and often suitable boundary conditions.  The operators produced by the  BilinearForm  classes involve\nintegrations and therefore they sum the various contributions from\nneighboring elements to compute a full integral.  The DiscreteLinearOperator  classes are not performing integrals but\nrather interpolations and as such they do not combine contributions\nfrom different elements in any way.  Consequently if the LinearInterpolator s produce different results for entities that are\nshared between neighboring elements then the resulting representation\nwill depend on the order in which the elements are processed.  Such\noperators are not good candidates for  DiscreteLinearOperator s.  The\nsections below will offer some guidance on the appropriate use of these\noperators.

These relations start with the definitions:\n\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n    \\D \n = \\epsilon_0\\E + \\P \\label{const_d}  \\\\\n    \\B \n = \\mu_0(\\H + \\M)    \\label{const_b}\n  \\end{align}$$\n\n\nWhere $\\P$ is the \npolarization density\n, and $\\M$ is the \nmagnetization\n.\nAlso, $\\epsilon_0$ is the \npermittivity of free space\n and $\\mu_0$ is the\n\npermeability of free space\n which are both constants of nature. In many common\nmaterials the polarization density can be approximated as a scalar multiple of\nthe electric field, i.e., $\\P = \\epsilon_0\\chi\\E$, where $\\chi$ is called the\n\nelectric susceptibility\n. In such cases we usually use the relation $\\D =\n\\epsilon\\E$ with $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_0(1 + \\chi)$ and call $\\epsilon$ the\n\npermittivity\n of the material.\n\n\nThe nature of magnetization is more complicated but we will take a very\nsimplified view which is valid in many situations. Specifically, we will assume\nthat either $\\M$ is proportional to $\\H$ yielding the relation $\\B = \\mu\\H$\nwhere $\\mu = \\mu_0(1 + \\chi_M)$ and $\\chi_M$ is the \nmagnetic susceptibility\n\nor that $\\M$ is independent of the applied field. The former case pertains to\nboth diamagnetic and paramagnetic materials and the latter to ferromagnetic\nmaterials.\n\n\nFinally we should note that equations \\eqref{ampere} and \\eqref{gauss} can be\ncombined to yield the equation of charge continuity $\\dd{\\rho}{t} + \\div\\J = 0$\nwhich can be important in plasma physics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).\n\n\nElectrostatics\n\n\nElectrostatic problems come in a variety of subtypes but they all derive from\nGauss's Law and Faraday's Law (equations \\eqref{gauss} and \\eqref{faraday}).\nWhen we assume no time variation, Faraday's Law becomes simply $\\curl\\E = 0$.\nThis suggests that the electric field can be expressed as the gradient of a\nscalar field which is traditionally taken to be $-\\varphi$, i.e.\n\n\n$$\\E = -\\grad\\varphi   \\label{gradphi}$$\n\n\nwhere $\\varphi$ is called the \nelectric potential\n and has units of Volts in\nthe SI system. Inserting this definition into equation \\eqref{gauss} gives:\n\n\n$$-\\div\\epsilon\\grad\\varphi = \\rho - \\div\\P   \\label{poisson}$$\n\n\nwhich is \nPoisson's equation\n for the electric potential, where we have assumed\na linear constitutive relation between $\\D$ and $\\E$ of the form $\\D =\n\\epsilon\\E + \\P$. This allows a polarization which is proportional to $\\E$ as\nwell a polarization independent of $\\E$. If this relation happens to be\nnonlinear then Poisson's equation would need to be replaced with a more\ncomplicated nonlinear expression.\n\n\nThe solutions to equation \\eqref{poisson} are non unique because they can be\nshifted by any additive constant. This means that we must apply a Dirichlet\nboundary condition at least at one point in the problem domain in order to\nobtain a solution. Typically this point will be on the boundary but it need not\nbe so. Such a Dirichlet value is equivalent to fixing the voltage (a.k.a.\npotential) at one or more locations. Additionally, this equation admits a normal\nderivative boundary condition. This corresponds to setting $\\hat{n}\\cdot\\D$ to a\nprescribed value on some portion of the boundary. This is equivalent to defining\na surface charge density on that portion of the boundary.\n\n\nVolta Mini Application\n\n\nThe electrostatics mini application, named \nvolta\n after the inventor of the\n\nvoltaic pile\n, is intended to\ndemonstrate how to solve standard electrostatics problems in MFEM. Its source\nterms and boundary conditions are simple but they should indicate how more\nspecialized sources or boundary conditions could be implemented.\n\n\n\n\nNote that this application assumes the mesh coordinates are given in meters.\n\n\nMini Application Features\n\n\nPermittivity:\n The permittivity, $\\epsilon$, is assumed to be that of free\n  space except for an optional sphere of dielectric material which can be\n  defined by the user. The command line option \n-ds\n can be used to set the\n  parameters for this dielectric sphere. For example, to produce a sphere at the\n  origin with a radius of 0.5 and a relative permittivity of 3 the user would\n  specify: \n-ds '0 0 0 0.5 3'\n.\n\n\nCharge Density:\n The charge density, $\\rho$, is assumed to be zero except for\n  an optional sphere of uniform charge density which can be defined by the user.\n  The command line option for this is \n-cs\n which follows the same pattern as\n  the dielectric sphere. Note that the last entry is the total charge of the\n  sphere and not its charge density.\n\n\nPolarization:\n A polarization vector function, $\\P$, can be imposed as a\n  source of the electric field. The command line option \n-vp\n creates a\n  polarization due to a simple voltaic pile, i.e., a cylinder which is\n  electrically polarized along its axis. The user should specify the two end\n  points of the cylinder axis, its radius and the magnitude of the polarization\n  vector.\n\n\nDirichlet BC:\n Dirichlet boundary conditions can either specify piecewise\n  constant voltages on a collection of surfaces or they can specify a gradient\n  field which approximates a uniform applied electric field. In either case the\n  user specifies the surfaces where the Dirichlet boundary condition should be\n  applied using the \n-dbcs\n option followed by a list of boundary attributes.\n  For example to select surfaces 2, 3, and 4 the user would use the following:\n  \n-dbcs '2 3 4'\n.\n\n\nTo apply a gradient field on these surfaces the user would also use the\n  \n-dbcg\n option. This defaults to the uniform field $\\E = (0,0,1)$ in 3D or\n  $\\E = (0,1)$ in 2D. An arbitrary vector can be specified with \n-uebc\n\n  followed by the desired vector, e.g., to apply $\\E = (1,2,3)$ the user would\n  supply: \n-uebc '1 2 3'\n.\n\n\nTo specify piecewise constant potential values the user would list the\n  desired values after \n-dbcv\n as follows: \n-dbcv '0.0 1.0 -1.0'\n.\n\n\nNeumann BC:\n Neumann boundary conditions set the normal component of the\n  electric displacement on portions of the boundary. This normal component is\n  equivalent to the surface charge density on the surface. This is rarely used\n  because surface charge densities are rarely known unless they are know to be\n  zero. However, if the surface charge density is zero then the Neumann BCs are\n  not needed because this is the natural boundary condition. Only piecewise\n  constant Neumann boundary conditions are supported. They can be set\n  analogously to piecewise Dirichlet boundary conditions but using options\n  \n-nbcs\n and \n-nbcv\n.\n\n\nMagnetostatics\n\n\nMagnetostatic problems arise when we assume no time variation in Amp\u00e9re's Law\n\\eqref{ampere} which leads to:\n\n\n$$\\curl\\H = \\J   \\nonumber$$\n\n\nWe will again assume a somewhat more general constitutive relation between $\\H$\nand $\\vec{B}$ than is normally seen:\n\n\n$$\\B = \\mu\\H + \\mu_0\\M = \\mu_0(1 + \\chi_M)\\H + \\mu_0\\M   \\nonumber$$\n\n\nWhere the magnetization is split into two portions; one which is proportional\nto $\\H$ and given by $\\chi_M\\H$, and another which is independent of $\\H$ and\nis given by $\\M$. This allows for paramagnetic and/or diamagnetic materials\ndefined through $\\mu$ as well as ferromagnetic materials represented by $\\M$.\nThis choice yields:\n\n\n$$\\curl\\mu^{-1}\\B = \\J + \\curl\\mu^{-1}\\mu_0\\M   \\nonumber$$\n\n\nWhich, when combined with equation \\eqref{divb}, becomes:\n\n\n$$\\curl\\mu^{-1}\\curl\\A = \\J + \\curl\\mu^{-1}\\mu_0\\M $$\n\n\nIf $\\J$ happens to be zero we have another option because we can assume that\n$\\H = -\\grad\\varphi_M$ for some scalar potential $\\varphi_M$. When combined\nwith equation \\eqref{divb} this leads to:\n\n\n$$\\div\\mu\\grad\\varphi_M = \\div\\mu_0\\M $$\n\n\nCurrently only the vector potential equation is used so we will focus on that\nfor the remainder of this document.\n\n\nThe vector potential is again non unique so we must apply additional\nconstraints in order to arrive at a solution for $\\A$. When working\nanalytically it is common to constrain the solution by restricting the\ndivergence of $\\A$ but numerically this leads to other complications. For our\nproblems of interest it will be necessary to require Dirichlet boundary\nconditions on the entire outer surface in order to sufficiently constrain the\nsolution.\n\n\nDirichlet boundary conditions for the vector potential on a surface provide a\nmeans to specify the component of $\\B$ normal to that surface. For example,\nsetting the tangential components of $\\A$ to be zero on a particular surface\nresults in a magnetic flux density which must be tangent to that surface.\n\n\nTesla Mini Application\n\n\nThe magnetostatics mini application, named \ntesla\n after the unit of magnetic\nfield strength (and of course the man Nikola Tesla), is intended to demonstrate\nhow to solve standard magnetostatics problems in MFEM. Its source terms and\nboundary conditions are simple but they should indicate how more specialized\nsources of boundary conditions could be implemented.\n\n\n\n\nNote that this application assumes the mesh coordinates are given in meters.\n\n\nMini Application Features\n\n\nPermeability:\n The permeability, $\\mu$, is assumed to be that of free space\n  except for an optional spherical shell of diamagnetic or paramagnetic material\n  which can be defined by the user. The command line option \n-ms\n can be used to\n  set the parameters for this shell.\n\n\nFor example, to produce a shell at the origin with inner and outer radii of\n  0.4 and 0.5 respectively and a relative permeability of 3 the user would\n  specify: \n-ms '0 0 0 0.4 0.5 3'\n.\n\n\nCurrent Density:\n The current density, $\\J$, is assumed to be zero except for\n  an optional ring of constant current which can be defined by the user. The\n  command line option for this is \n-cr\n which requires two points giving the end\n  points of the ring's axis, inner and outer radii, and a constant total\n  current.\n\n\nFor example, to specify a ring centered at the origin and laying in the XY\n  plane with a thickness of 0.2 and radii 0.4 and 0.5, and a current of 2 amps\n  the user would give: \n-cr 0 0 -0.1 0 0 0.1 0.4 0.5 2\n.\n\n\nMagnetization:\n A permanent magnetization, $\\M$, can be applied in the form\n  of a cylindrical magnet with poles at its circular ends. The command line\n  option is \n-bm\n which indicates a 'bar magnet'. The option requires the two\n  end points of the cylinder's axis, its radius, and the magnitude of the\n  magnetization.\n\n\nSurface Current Density:\n A surface current can be imposed indirectly by\n  specifying separate surface patches with different voltages as well as a\n  collection of surface patches connecting the voltages through which the\n  current will flow. The voltage surfaces and their voltages can be specified\n  using \n-vbcs\n followed by the indices of the surfaces and \n-vbcv\n followed by\n  their voltages. The path for the surface current ($\\vec{K}$) is specified by\n  using \n-kbcs\n followed by a set of surface indices.\n\n\nFor example, applying voltages 1 and -1 to surfaces 2 and 3 with a current\n  path along surfaces 4 and 6 would be specified as:\n  \n-vbcs '2 3' -vbcv '1 -1' -kbcs '4 6'\n.\n\n\nAny surfaces not listed as voltage or current surfaces will be assigned as\n  homogeneous Dirichlet boundaries. Note that when this option is selected an\n  auxiliary electrostatic problem will be solved on the surface of the\n  geometry to compute the surface current.\n\n\nDirichlet BC:\n Dirichlet boundary conditions are required if a surface\n  current density is not defined. For this reason the user need not specify\n  boundary surfaces by number since the boundary condition must be applied on\n  all of them. The default boundary condition is a homogeneous Dirichlet\n  boundary condition on all outer surfaces. This means that the normal\n  component of $\\B$ will be zero at the outer boundary. An alternative is to\n  specify a desired uniform magnetic flux density on the entire outer surface.\n  This is accomplished with the \n-ubbc\n command line option followed by the\n  desired $\\B$ vector.\n\n\nTransient Full-Wave Electromagnetics\n\n\nTransient electromagnetics problems are governed by the time-dependent\nMaxwell equations \\eqref{ampere} and \\eqref{faraday} when combined\nusing the constitutive relations \\eqref{const_d} and \\eqref{const_b}.\nWhen combined these equations can describe the evolution and\npropagation of electromagnetic waves.\n\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n    \\dd{(\\epsilon\\E)}{t} \n =   \\curl(\\mu^{-1}\\B) - \\sigma \\E - \\J  \\\\\n    \\dd{\\B}{t}           \n = - \\curl\\E\n  \\end{align}$$\n\n\nThe term $\\sigma\\E$ arises in the presence of electrically conductive\nmaterials where the electric field induces a current which can be\nseparated from $\\J$.  In such cases the total current appearing in\nAmp\u00e9re's Law \\eqref{ampere} can be expressed as the sum of an applied\ncurrent (also labeled as $\\J$) and an induced current $\\sigma\\E$.\n\n\nSolving these equations requires initial conditions for both the\nelectric and magnetic fields $\\E$ and $\\B$ as well as boundary\nconditions related to the tangential components of $\\E$ or $\\H$.\nOther formulations are possible such as evolving $\\H$ and $\\D$ or the\npotentials $\\varphi$ and $\\A$.  This system of equations can also be\nwritten as a single second order equation involving only $\\E$, $\\H$,\n$\\varphi$, or $\\A$.  Each of these formulations has a different set of\nsources, initial and boundary conditions for which it is well-suited.\nThe choice we make here is perhaps the most common but it may not be\nthe most convenient choice for a given application.\n\n\nThese equations can be used to evolve their initial conditions or they\ncan be driven by either a current source or through time-varying\nboundary conditions.  It is also possible to combine all three of\nthese sources in a single simulation.\n\n\nMaxwell Mini Application\n\n\nThe electrodynamics mini application, named \nmaxwell\n after James Clerk Maxwell\nwho first formulated the classical theory of electromagnetic radiation, is\nintended to demonstrate how to solve transient wave problems in MFEM. Its source\nterms and boundary conditions are simple but they should indicate how more\nspecialized sources or boundary conditions could be implemented.\n\n\nAn example simulation is depicted below (click to animate the wave propagation).\n\n\n\n\nTime integration is handled by a variable order symplectic time integration\nalgorithm.  This algorithm is designed for systems of equations which are\nderived from a Hamiltonian and it helps to ensure energy conservation within\nsome tolerance.  The time step used during integration is automatically chosen\nbased on the largest stable time step as computed from the largest eigenvalue of\nthe update equations.  This determination involves a user-adjustable factor\nwhich creates a safety margin.  By default the actual time step is less than 95%\nof the estimate for the largest stable time step.\n\n\nNote that this application assumes the mesh coordinates are given in meters.\nInternally the code assumes time is in seconds but the command line options use\nnanoseconds for convenience.\n\n\nMini Application Features\n\n\nTime Evolution:\n The initial and final times for the simulation can be\n  specified, in nanoseconds, with the \n-ti\n and \n-tf\n options.  Visualization\n  snapshots of data will be written out after time intervals specified by \n-ts\n\n  which again given in nanoseconds.  The order of the time integration can be\n  specified, from 1 to 4, using the \n-to\n option.\n\n\nPermittivity:\n The permittivity, $\\epsilon$, is assumed to be that of free\n  space except for an optional sphere of dielectric material which can be\n  defined by the user. The command line option \n-ds\n can be used to set the\n  parameters for this dielectric sphere. For example, to produce a sphere at the\n  origin with a radius of 0.5 and a relative permittivity of 3 the user would\n  specify: \n-ds '0 0 0 0.5 3'\n.\n\n\nPermeability:\n The permeability, $\\mu$, is assumed to be that of free space\n  except for an optional spherical shell of diamagnetic or paramagnetic material\n  which can be defined by the user.

For example, to produce a sphere at the origin with a\n  radius of 0.5 and a conductivity of 3,000,000 S/m the user would specify: \n-cs\n  '0 0 0 0.5 3e6'\n.\n\n\nCurrent Density:\n The current density, $\\J$, is assumed to be zero except for\n  an optional cylinder of pulsed current which can be defined by the user.  The\n  command line option for this is \n-dp\n, short for 'dipole pulse', which\n  requires two points giving the end points of the cylinder's axis, radius,\n  amplitude ($\\alpha$), pulse center ($\\beta$), and a pulse width ($\\gamma$).\n  The time dependence of this pulse is given by: $$\\J(t) = \\hat{a} \\alpha\n  e^{-(t-\\beta)^2/(2\\gamma^2)}$$ Where $\\hat{a}$ is the unit vector along the\n  cylinder's axis and both $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are specified in nanoseconds.\n\n\nDirichlet BC:\n Homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, which constrain the\n  tangential components of $\\frac{\\partial\\E}{\\partial t}$ to be zero, can be\n  activated on a portion of the boundary by specifying a list of boundary\n  attributes such as \n-dbcs '4 8'\n.  For convenience a boundary attribute of\n  '-1' can be used to specify all boundary surfaces.  Non-Homogeneous,\n  time-dependent Dirichlet boundary conditions are supported by the Maxwell\n  solver so a user can edit \nmaxwell.cpp\n and supply their own function if\n  desired.\n\n\nAbsorbing BC:\n A first order Sommerfeld absorbing boundary condition can be\n  applied to a portion of the boundary using the \n-abcs\n option along with a\n  list of boundary attributes such as \n-abcs '4 18'\n.

The equations of low-frequency electromagnetics are coupled\nwith the equations of heat transfer. The coupling is one way, electromagnetics generates Joule\nheating, but the heating does not affect the electromagnetics.  The thermal problem\nis solved using an $H(\\mathrm{div})$ method, i.e. temperature is discontinuous and the\nthermal flux $\\F$ is in $H(\\mathrm{div})$.\nThere are three linear solves per time step:\n\n\n\n\nPoisson's equation for the scalar electric potential is solved using the AMG\n preconditioner,\n\n\nthe electric diffusion equation is solved using the AMS preconditioner, and\n\n\nthe thermal diffusion equation is solved using the ADS preconditioner.\n\n\n\n\nTwo example meshes are provided, one is a straight circular metal rod in vacuum, the other is a helical\ncoil in vacuum (the latter is 21MB and can be downloaded from \nhere\n).\nThe idea is that a voltage is applied to the ends of the rod/coil, the electric field diffuses\ninto the metal, the metal is heated by Joule heating, the heat diffuses out.\n\n\nThe equations are:\n\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n    \\div\\sigma\\grad\\Phi \n= 0 \\\\\n    \\sigma \\E \n= \\curl\\mu^{-1} \\B - \\sigma \\grad \\Phi \\\\\n    \\frac{d \\B}{d t} \n= - \\curl \\E \\\\\n    \\F \n= -k \\grad T \\\\\n    c \\frac{d T}{d t} \n= - \\div \\F + \\sigma \\E \\cdot \\E\n  \\end{align}$$\n\n\nThe equations are integrated in time using implicit time integration, either midpoint or\nhigher order SDIRK.\n\n\nSince there are three solves,  three sets of boundary conditions must be specified. The\nessential BC's are the scalar potential, the electric field, and the thermal flux. These are not\nset via command line arguments, you have to edit the code to change these. To change these,\nsearch the code for \ness_bdr\n\n\nThere are conducting and non-conducting material regions, and the mesh must have integer attributes\nto specify these regions. To change these, search the code for \nstd::map\nint, double\n this maps the\ninteger attribute to the floating-point material value.\n\n\nNote that this application assumes the mesh coordinates are given in meters.\n\n\n\n\nThe above picture shows Joule heating of a cylinder using the mesh \ncylinder-hex.mesh\n. The cylinder is\nsurrounded by vacuum. The black arrows show the magnetic field $\\B$, the magenta arrows show the heat\nflux $\\F$, and the pseudocolor in the center of the cylinder shows the temperature.\n\n\nMini Application Features\n\n\nBoundary Conditions:\n Since there are three solves,  three sets of boundary conditions must be specified.

In such cases we usually use the relation $\\D =\n\\epsilon\\E$ with $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_0(1 + \\chi)$ and call $\\epsilon$ the permittivity  of the material.

Non-Homogeneous,\n  time-dependent Dirichlet boundary conditions are supported by the Maxwell\n  solver so a user can edit  maxwell.cpp  and supply their own function if\n  desired.  Absorbing BC:  A first order Sommerfeld absorbing boundary condition can be\n  applied to a portion of the boundary using the  -abcs  option along with a\n  list of boundary attributes such as  -abcs '4 18' .  Again, the special\n  purpose boundary attribute '-1' can be used to specify all boundary surfaces.\n  This boundary condition depends on a coefficient,\n  $\\eta^{-1}=\\sqrt{\\epsilon/\\mu}$, which must be matched to the materials just\n  inside the boundary.  The code assumes that the permittivity and permeability\n  are those of the vacuum near the surface but, if this is not the case, an\n  ambitious user can replace  etaInvCoef_  with a more appropriate function.",

The equations of low-frequency electromagnetics are coupled\nwith the equations of heat transfer. The coupling is one way, electromagnetics generates Joule\nheating, but the heating does not affect the electromagnetics.  The thermal problem\nis solved using an $H(\\mathrm{div})$ method, i.e. temperature is discontinuous and the\nthermal flux $\\F$ is in $H(\\mathrm{div})$.\nThere are three linear solves per time step:   Poisson's equation for the scalar electric potential is solved using the AMG\n preconditioner,  the electric diffusion equation is solved using the AMS preconditioner, and  the thermal diffusion equation is solved using the ADS preconditioner.   Two example meshes are provided, one is a straight circular metal rod in vacuum, the other is a helical\ncoil in vacuum (the latter is 21MB and can be downloaded from  here ).\nThe idea is that a voltage is applied to the ends of the rod/coil, the electric field diffuses\ninto the metal, the metal is heated by Joule heating, the heat diffuses out.  The equations are:  $$\\begin{align}\n    \\div\\sigma\\grad\\Phi  = 0 \\\\\n    \\sigma \\E  = \\curl\\mu^{-1} \\B - \\sigma \\grad \\Phi \\\\\n    \\frac{d \\B}{d t}  = - \\curl \\E \\\\\n    \\F  = -k \\grad T \\\\\n    c \\frac{d T}{d t}  = - \\div \\F + \\sigma \\E \\cdot \\E\n  \\end{align}$$  The equations are integrated in time using implicit time integration, either midpoint or\nhigher order SDIRK.  Since there are three solves,  three sets of boundary conditions must be specified. The\nessential BC's are the scalar potential, the electric field, and the thermal flux. These are not\nset via command line arguments, you have to edit the code to change these. To change these,\nsearch the code for  ess_bdr  There are conducting and non-conducting material regions, and the mesh must have integer attributes\nto specify these regions. To change these, search the code for  std::map int, double  this maps the\ninteger attribute to the floating-point material value.  Note that this application assumes the mesh coordinates are given in meters.   The above picture shows Joule heating of a cylinder using the mesh  cylinder-hex.mesh .

The sections\n\ndimension\n, \nelements\n, and \nboundary\n are the same as in MFEM mesh v1.0 and\nare followed by two new (optional) sections, \nvertex_parents\n and\n\ncoarse_elements\n:\n\n\n# Vertex hierarchy\nvertex_parents\n\nnumber of relations\n\n\nvertex index\n \nparent 1 index\n \nparent 2 index\n\n...\n\n# Element hierarchy\ncoarse_elements\n\nnumber of coarse elements\n\n\nrefinement type\n \nchild index 1\n ... \nchild index n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\nThese are followed by the standard sections \nvertices\n and \nnodes\n of the format\nMFEM mesh v1.0.\n\n\nThe new section \nvertex_parents\n identifies all vertices (by their zero-based\nindex) that have been created as new mid-edge vertices by adaptive refinement\nof elements. Each such vertex has exactly two \"parents\" identified again by two\nzero-based indices. This information is needed to construct constraining\nrelations in a mesh with hanging nodes. The order the vertex-parent relations\nare stated in the file is not significant.\n\n\nThe second optional section \ncoarse_elements\n describes the element refinement\nhierarchy. While the standard section \nelements\n lists all leaf elements of the\nrefinement tree, this section describes all elements that have been refined and\nare no longer active. Each line describes one such virtual element, its\nrefinement type and up to 8 children. Child indices between 0 and \nN-1\n refer\nto the \nN\n active elements in the \nelements\n section. A coarse element has an\nimplied index starting with \nN\n. A coarse element can refer to another coarse\nelement of \nindex \n= N\n, but only after such child has been defined in the\n\ncoarse_elements\n section. The hierarchy is thus represented from the bottom\nup. The refinement types are: 1=X, 2=Y, 4=Z, 3=XY, 5=XZ, 6=YZ, 7=XYZ, where X,\nY, Z refer to one or more splits in the respective axes of the element\nreference domain. If the entire section is missing, MFEM will not be able to\nderefine the mesh.\n\n\n\n\nThe files\n\namr-quad.mesh\n,\n\namr-hex.mesh\n and\n\nfichera-amr.mesh\n\n(above) in the \ndata\n directory are examples of AMR meshes.\n\n\nNURBS meshes\n\n\nMFEM provides full support for meshes and discretization spaces based on Non-uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). These are treated similarly to general \ncurvilinear meshes\n where the NURBS nodes are specified as a grid function at the end of the mesh file.\n\n\nFor example, here is a simple quadratic NURBS mesh for a square domain with a (perfectly) circular hole in the middle.

We use the vertex numbers as labels, so we only need the number of vertices.\n\n\nIn the NURBS case we need to also provide description of the edges on the patch boundaries and associate a knot vector with each of them. This is done in the \nedges\n section where the first index in each row refers to the knot vector id (from the following \nknotvectors\n section), while the remaining two indexes are the edge vertex numbers.\n\n\nThe position of the NURBS nodes (control points) is given as a NURBS grid function at the end of the file, while the associated weights are listed in the preceding \nweights\n section.\n\n\nSome examples of VTK meshes can be found in MFEM's \ndata directory\n.

Below is a description of our current approach...\n\n\nFinite element spaces have degrees of freedom (dofs) that are associated with the (interiors of the) mesh vertices, edges, faces and elements.\nThere may be multiple dofs associated with the same geometric entity (e.g. vector fields), and different spaces have different sets of degrees of freedom.\nFor example H1/continuous spaces can have degrees of freedom associated with the Gauss-Lobatto points in a quadrilateral, while L2/discontinuous spaces can have degrees of freedom associated with the Gauss-Legendre points.\nThese are just examples, many choices for the basis are actually possible to be encoded in the \nFiniteElementCollection\n string above.\n\n\nIn general, based just on the mesh topology and the type of the space, the \nFiniteElementSpace\n object can determine a global set of dofs, that will be the values listed for the mesh \nnodes\n.\n\n\nThe algorithm starts with the given numbering of the elements and the vertices, from which a numbering of the edges and the faces is derived as follows:\n\n\nloop over elements\n  loop over edges and faces inside each element (clock-wise)\n    number currently the edges and faces that have not been numbered yet\n\n\n\n\nHere is the result of this numbering for the beam mesh\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to a number, each edges and face is also given a global orientation.\n\n\nIn 2D and 3D, an edge is oriented from the vertex with the lower vertex id to the vertex with the higher vertex id.\n\n\nIn 3D, a face is oriented according to the face-to-vertex mappings in the first element in which the face is enumerated. See the \nfem/geom.cpp\n for the definitions of the \ntetrahedral\n and \nhexahedral\n mappings on the reference element, as well as the \nMesh::GenerateFaces\n method in \nmesh/mesh.cpp\n. In particular, the normal of the face between two elements points from the element with lower number to the element with higher number. Face orientation however includes not just the normal direction, but also any rotation of the vertices compared to the base, i.e. \norientation\n here means permutation of vertices.\n\n\nThe global numbering of degrees of freedom is now performed as follows:\n\n\nloop over vertices\n  list the dofs associated with each vertex\n\nloop over edges\n  list the dofs associated with the interior of the edge,\n  lexicographically with respect to the edge orientation\n\nloop over faces\n  list the dofs associated with the interior of the face,\n  lexicographically with respect to the face orientation\n\nloop over elements\n  list the dofs associated with the interior of the element\n\n\n\n\nAn example of this is the quadratic mesh in  \nListing 3\n\n\n...\n# BEGIN Geometry Part\n\nnodes\nFiniteElementSpace\nFiniteElementCollection: H1_2D_P2\nVDim: 2\nOrdering: 1\n\n# 18 vertex dofs\n0 0\n1 0\n2 0\n3 0\n4 0\n5 0\n6 0\n7 0\n8 0\n0 1\n1 1\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 1\n7 1\n8 1\n\n# 25 edge dofs\n0.5 0\n1 0.5\n0.5 1\n0 0.5\n1.5 0\n2 0.5\n1.5 1\n2.5 0\n3 0.5\n2.5 1\n3.5 0\n4 0.5\n3.5 1\n4.5 0\n5 0.5\n4.5 1\n5.5 0\n6 0.5\n5.5 1\n6.5 0\n7 0.5\n6.5 1\n7.5 0\n8 0.5\n7.5 1\n\n# 8 element dofs\n0.5 0.5\n1.5 0.5\n2.5 0.5\n3.5 0.5\n4.5 0.5\n5.5 0.5\n6.5 0.5\n7.5 0.5\n\n# END Geometry Part\n...\n\n\n\n\nListings\n\n\nListing 1\n\n\nThis is the original version of the \nbeam-quad.mesh\n using the linear mesh format.\n\n\nMFEM mesh v1.0\n\n#\n# MFEM Geometry Types (see mesh/geom.hpp):\n#\n# POINT       = 0\n# SEGMENT     = 1\n# TRIANGLE    = 2\n# SQUARE      = 3\n# TETRAHEDRON = 4\n# CUBE        = 5\n#\n\ndimension\n2\n\nelements\n8\n1 3 0 1 10 9\n1 3 1 2 11 10\n1 3 2 3 12 11\n1 3 3 4 13 12\n2 3 4 5 14 13\n2 3 5 6 15 14\n2 3 6 7 16 15\n2 3 7 8 17 16\n\nboundary\n18\n3 1 0 1\n3 1 1 2\n3 1 2 3\n3 1 3 4\n3 1 4 5\n3 1 5 6\n3 1 6 7\n3 1 7 8\n3 1 10 9\n3 1 11 10\n3 1 12 11\n3 1 13 12\n3 1 14 13\n3 1 15 14\n3 1 16 15\n3 1 17 16\n1 1 9 0\n2 1 8 17\n\nvertices\n18\n2\n0 0\n1 0\n2 0\n3 0\n4 0\n5 0\n6 0\n7 0\n8 0\n0 1\n1 1\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 1\n7 1\n8 1\n\n\n\n\n\nListing 2\n\n\nThis is a \nMFEM mesh v1.x\n version of the \nbeam-quad.mesh\n which is first order.

            "text": "To fully specify the  MFEM mesh v1.x format, we need to describe the degrees of freedom of the  nodes  finite element space and their global numbering.  This is something that the MFEM team is very interested to discuss and standardize with other high-order projects and applications. Below is a description of our current approach...  Finite element spaces have degrees of freedom (dofs) that are associated with the (interiors of the) mesh vertices, edges, faces and elements.\nThere may be multiple dofs associated with the same geometric entity (e.g. vector fields), and different spaces have different sets of degrees of freedom.\nFor example H1/continuous spaces can have degrees of freedom associated with the Gauss-Lobatto points in a quadrilateral, while L2/discontinuous spaces can have degrees of freedom associated with the Gauss-Legendre points.\nThese are just examples, many choices for the basis are actually possible to be encoded in the  FiniteElementCollection  string above.  In general, based just on the mesh topology and the type of the space, the  FiniteElementSpace  object can determine a global set of dofs, that will be the values listed for the mesh  nodes .  The algorithm starts with the given numbering of the elements and the vertices, from which a numbering of the edges and the faces is derived as follows:  loop over elements\n  loop over edges and faces inside each element (clock-wise)\n    number currently the edges and faces that have not been numbered yet  Here is the result of this numbering for the beam mesh   In addition to a number, each edges and face is also given a global orientation.  In 2D and 3D, an edge is oriented from the vertex with the lower vertex id to the vertex with the higher vertex id.  In 3D, a face is oriented according to the face-to-vertex mappings in the first element in which the face is enumerated. See the  fem/geom.cpp  for the definitions of the  tetrahedral  and  hexahedral  mappings on the reference element, as well as the  Mesh::GenerateFaces  method in  mesh/mesh.cpp . In particular, the normal of the face between two elements points from the element with lower number to the element with higher number. Face orientation however includes not just the normal direction, but also any rotation of the vertices compared to the base, i.e.  orientation  here means permutation of vertices.  The global numbering of degrees of freedom is now performed as follows:  loop over vertices\n  list the dofs associated with each vertex\n\nloop over edges\n  list the dofs associated with the interior of the edge,\n  lexicographically with respect to the edge orientation\n\nloop over faces\n  list the dofs associated with the interior of the face,\n  lexicographically with respect to the face orientation\n\nloop over elements\n  list the dofs associated with the interior of the element  An example of this is the quadratic mesh in   Listing 3  ...\n# BEGIN Geometry Part\n\nnodes\nFiniteElementSpace\nFiniteElementCollection: H1_2D_P2\nVDim: 2\nOrdering: 1\n\n# 18 vertex dofs\n0 0\n1 0\n2 0\n3 0\n4 0\n5 0\n6 0\n7 0\n8 0\n0 1\n1 1\n2 1\n3 1\n4 1\n5 1\n6 1\n7 1\n8 1\n\n# 25 edge dofs\n0.5 0\n1 0.5\n0.5 1\n0 0.5\n1.5 0\n2 0.5\n1.5 1\n2.5 0\n3 0.5\n2.5 1\n3.5 0\n4 0.5\n3.5 1\n4.5 0\n5 0.5\n4.5 1\n5.5 0\n6 0.5\n5.5 1\n6.5 0\n7 0.5\n6.5 1\n7.5 0\n8 0.5\n7.5 1\n\n# 8 element dofs\n0.5 0.5\n1.5 0.5\n2.5 0.5\n3.5 0.5\n4.5 0.5\n5.5 0.5\n6.5 0.5\n7.5 0.5\n\n# END Geometry Part\n...",

It is constructed from a mesh (e.g. class \nTMesh\n) and shape evaluator\n   (e.g. class \nShapeEvaluator\n) objects. Allows computation of physical\n   coordinates and Jacobian matrices corresponding to the reference integration\n   points. The desired result (a combination of coordinates and/or Jacobian\n   matrices at quadrature points, element attribute and/or element index) is\n   specified through the template sub-class \nResult\n and stored in an object of\n   the same type. The idea of this approach is to eliminate unnecessary\n   evaluations if they are not needed. The need is determined based on what the\n   particular \"users\" need. The \"users\" are the templated \nCoefficient\n and\n   \nKernel\n (see \nfem/tbilininteg.hpp\n below) classes which specify what they\n   need through static constant boolean variables, e.g. \nuses_coordinates\n,\n   \nuses_Jacobians\n, etc.\n\n\nfem/tevaluator.hpp\n\n\nClasses for evaluating FE basis, \nShapeEvaluator\n, and finite element\n   functions, \nFieldEvaluator\n, and their derivatives at quadrature points,\n   templated by a finite element class and an integration rule class. These\n   correspond to the $B$ and $BG$ matrices above.

These classes also specify the \ntype\n of\n   the local operator that needs to be applied before and after the $D$ matrix -\n   these are the $B_{in}$ and $B^T_{out}$ matrices, respectively. The product\n   $B^T_{out} D B_{in}$ is the local element matrix, which is the result when\n   using the \nBilinearFormIntegrator\n classes. This specifications of the types\n   are given by static constant boolean variables, e.g. \nin_values\n and\n   \nout_values\n. The \nKernel\n classes provide the following methods:\n\n\n\n\nAction\n: evaluate the action of $D$ \nwithout\n explicitly storing the\n     partially assembled data; this is needed for matrix-free action.\n\n\nAssemble\n: evaluate the partially assembled data, $D$, which is\n     kernel-specific: e.g., for mass, the data is one scalar per quadrature\n     point; for diffusion, the data is one $d\\times d$ matrix (in $d$-dimensions)\n     per quadrature point.\n\n\nMultAssembled\n: perform the action of $D$ using the pre-computed partially\n     assembled data.\n\n\n\n\nfem/tbilinearform.hpp\n\n\nBilinear form operator, templated on the mesh, finite element space,\n   integration rule and bilinear form integrator. Corresponds to the $A$ matrix\n   above. Provides various assembly and evaluation schemes:\n\n\n\n\nMultUnassembled\n: matrix-free action using the mesh nodes and the input\n     vector.\n\n\nAssemble\n, \nMultAssembled\n: partial assembly and operator action using the\n     partially assembled data at quadrature points and the input vector.\n\n\nAssembleMatrix(DenseTensor \n)\n: assemble the local element matrices and\n     store them as \nDenseTensor\n.\n\n\nAssembleMatrix(SparseMatrix \n)\n: assemble the operator in a global (CSR)\n     \nSparseMatrix\n.\n\n\nAssembleBilinearForm(BilinearForm \n)\n: assemble element matrices and add\n     them to the bilinear form.\n\n\n\n\nminiapps/performance/makefile\n\n\nBy default \nmake\n builds the example drivers with the compiler used to\n   compile MFEM. If \ng++\n was used, a pseudo-code dump file with the optimized\n   code will be generated (option \n-fdump-tree-optimized-blocks\n).
